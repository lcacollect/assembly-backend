  "comment": "This is an estimate of a market average aggregate. It models a mixture of 64.2% land won, 27.5% recycled and secondary, and 8.3% marine aggregates. Consumption statistics have been taken from a report, by British Marine Aggregates Producer Association, a member of the  Mineral Products Association (MPA). [Tenth sustainable development report for the British marine aggregate industry, Dec 2016]. These results are sensitive to the embodied carbon of secondary aggregates, which is a material where data would benefit from improvement. If you know the specific type of aggregates you will use, then it is recommended to use a more specific category of aggregates.",
